<h4>Design Objectives</h4>

<p>
To find a creative way to display my assignments/blog posts. Very editorial but also just generally graphically engaging. 
</p>

<h4>Audience Needs</h4>

<p>
Audience: Mostly people interested in fashion I would say. 
</p>

<h4>Strategy</h4>

<p>
Serif fonts, editorial looking, image heavy but generally just very aesthetically pleasing. Emulating a magazine spread. 
</p>

<h4>Content Requirements</h4>

<p>
Street Style pictures, the written material/research.
</p>

<h4>Functional Requirement</h4>

<p>
Easy navigation through articles, creatively engaging and pleasing to look at. To be able to choose what article you want to read through a table of contents.
