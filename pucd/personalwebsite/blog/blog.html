    Around 11AM, I started walking towards Toby Estate Coffee 44. An ideal brunch timing in New York City. I love the West Village, the simple yet classic townhouses with exposed brick walls all lined up along the streets. A quiet neighborhood but it was not due to lack of people. The people here are just quiet, most of them working in coffee shops. Just like the architecture, the people emulate a simple and classic look. The dress sense, of course being winter consisted of a lot of Canada Goose. I would say everyone in this neighborhood is fairly wealthy, a lot of branded items here and there. No one wore anything out of the ordinary, neutral colors, classic turtlenecks, jeans. Paired together nicely with a watch or a bag. Simple, yet aesthetically pleasing. Similar to the overall environment in the coffee shop, with the clean and elegant typography and the bonzai plants and the recurring exposed brick walls with marquee lights. Everything around me, just screamed "Instaworthy." Everyone clearly thought the same because there was no shortage of picture-taking.   

    There is a certain sophistication in the simplicity.

    <h1>The Economic Impact of the Fashion Industry</h1>
    <h2>Feb 23, 2017</h2>

    <p>
    As the article The Economic Impact of the Fashion Industry states “Fashion is a $1.2 trillion global industry.” At then end of the day, a designer designs clothing and the consumer will buy the product if they like it, that itself is a measure of the designers success. If times are tough, for example if theres a recession then fashion trends start to reflect the hardship of the time. Yet if we look at the economic situation currently, after Trump winning presidency the stock market is doing great which means consumers are happy and that would mean they are willing to spend, to splurge. So it would be my educated guess that fashion trends would lean towards more extravagant and more lavish styles. That is just one potential example of a direct relationship between economics and fashion trends.

    There are numerous indirect and direct relationships in my opinion between economics and fashion trends. Sometimes fashion trends are more artistic reflections to whats going on in terms of current events, for example the grunge period during the Bush presidency was a rebellion to the previously popular super polished look. During the Clinton presidency, NAFTA took affect and the EU was formed and a there was just a lot of deficit reduction, meaning that commerce was increasing and stimulating wealth. This was correlated with the rise of denim, high end raw denim perhaps there is a correlation? Regardless, correlation does not prove causation. Sometimes economics impacts trends, or music, or art or other current events.

    In terms of focusing on New York City and the fashion trends here, New York holds the status of a global fashion capital with over 900 fashion companies, huge amounts of attention to all the events around fashion week. Because NYC is a fashion hub, a productive center for top fashion designers, wholesalers, retailers and  it would be one of the first places to analyze the change of trends. In NYC, fashion is a $98 billion industry their wholesale market for 27% of the US wholesale market., and as the article mentions that hubs and clusters starts to “research shows there are economic benefits when businesses in a particular industry cluster together in close proximity.” As I mentioned before in regards to how economics have a relationship with fashion trends, this is applicable to almost any place in the United States but more specifically places like New York and Los Angeles. I guess, New York would just be a place we would really start to see these trends start emerging and notice the public opinion.

    <h1>Fashion Change Theory in Pop Culture</h1>
    <h2>Mar 5, 2017</h2>

    <p>
      A pop culture trend that has been booming recently in our society is “feminism.” The recent political election instigated this concept to become a “trend” so to speak, as we see the masses in protests wearing slogans and phrases standing up for their rights. Our efforts to protect our rights as women and protect our equality is reflected in the fashion industry today. As a feminist I have mixed feelings labelling this as a “trend” just because then maybe we start to divert away from the real meaning and purpose of the word and the movement and it just becomes something thats “fashionable” and “cool.” However, it is the current issue and as a result the fashion industry will respond to what society is facing.

At this years New York Fashion Week, Dior designer Maria Grazia Chiuri debuted a shirt that had “We Should All Be Feminists” which has been seen worn on pop culture icon Rihanna and a known feminist spokesperson at the Women’s March and actress Natalie Portman. Another high-end designer who promoted feminism through his collection was Prabal Gurung who debuted a collection of with messages that said “The Future Is Female” and “Neverthless She Persisted.”

This years political election prompted many celebrities to speak up about their political stances, whether it was through their performances, presence in protests, campaigning with the political candidates or through their social media. Famous examples that come to mind would be Lady Gaga, Beyonce and Jay Z, Katy Perry, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, honestly so many celebrities from musicians to actors to models. Vogue also published an article stating their political opinion, which is extremely rare for a magazine especially one with such prestige. In my opinion, I think these celebrities speaking out had an indirect influence over the trend of “feminism,” I think they prompted their fans and raised awareness and encouraged others to partake in protests and stand up for everyones rights that were in jeopardy which not only meant women rights, but LGBTQ, immigrants and human rights in general.

Through the protests we see “pussy hats” and protest slogans and protest wear and I think that is really what had a direct influence on high-end brands to debut these T-Shirts with feminist sayings. I would say the Trickle-Across Theory would be most applicable to this trend. It wasn’t a matter of the elite introducing this fashion trend, it was due to the social situation and how the masses were reacting. It is also not a Trickle Up Theory just because the elite were simultaneously partaking in the public reaction and protests. We see the protests and the “normal” people with all these feminist slogans and protest signs, we see celebrities speaking up and wearing these feminist slogans and then we see them debuted in Fashion Week by high-end brands, and now there are going to be readily available T-Shirts at our fast fashion stores. I made a graph that resembles a "classic" fashion trend because I believe that "feminism" is a concept that has been going strong for years now and it has recently picked up even more due to current events, but it cannot be a concept that just fades away like a fad because it will always be a pressing issue.
