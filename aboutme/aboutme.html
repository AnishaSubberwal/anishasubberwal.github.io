My name is Anisha Subberwal. I'm 19 years old. I'm majoring in Communication Design. And, you're probably wondering what that entails. Its basically Digital Design, so I learn the basics and art of typography and graphic design but I also get to learn web design, User Experience and User Interface Design. Studying User Experience design is exactly what it is, desigining how the user navigates through the website/app and User Interface is just the aesthetic of it. Sorry, for boring you with some web terminology. My minor is Fashion Communication, I know... its a lot of communicating. Thats like fashion advertising, branding and merchandising. I currently intern at Jimmy Choo as a visual merchandiser, so I'm gaining a lot of work experience in my minor. I'm still trying to find a middle ground with everything I'm studying. 
A little more about me and less about my academics, I'm basically a foreigner everywhere I go. I moved from India which is my birthplace halfway through 4th grade. Then I moved to Indonesia for about 2 years and I went to the American International School. After that I moved to Singapore for about 2 and a half years and I went to a British School. Two schools actually. And then, I moved to Taiwan where I stayed about 11 months and switched back to the American system. And again there was another move before sophomore year of my high school, I moved to Hong Kong where my family currently resides. We're coming on to our 5th year and that seems amazing considering our moving history. 

Where are you from?
Wheres home for you?

Probably two of the hardest questions I have to answer. When I say Hong Kong, people usually say "Where are you really from? You don't look Chinese." I feel like I'm in that scene of Mean Girls. But when I moved out of India when I was really young, whenever I visit I feel like I'm in a foreign place. It just doesn't feel like home.
